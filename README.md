# Layout Design Tool

A simple webapp to assist in designing the layout of the Model A UI.

The webapp is used to iterate rapidly on layout designs based on at least three parameters:
- Margins between elements
- Dimensions of the standard key (square vs. non-square)
- Height of the top key row with respect to the bottom four rows (full-height vs. partial-height)

Iterating rapidly helps us to fine-tune the layout design for optimal usability and aesthetic quality.
